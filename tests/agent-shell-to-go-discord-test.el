;;; agent-shell-to-go-discord-test.el --- Tests for agent-shell-to-go-discord.el -*- lexical-binding: t; -*-

;; This file is not part of GNU Emacs.

;;; Commentary:
;;
;; Tests for the Discord transport implementation (agent-shell-to-go-discord.el).
;; Uses a mocked Discord REST API and a fake WebSocket — no real Discord backend required.
