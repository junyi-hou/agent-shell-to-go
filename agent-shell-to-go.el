;; Version: 0.3.0
;; Package-Requires: ((emacs "29.1") (agent-shell "0.50.1") (websocket "1.14"))
;; Keywords: convenience, tools, ai

;; This file is not part of GNU Emacs.

;;; Commentary:

;; agent-shell-to-go mirrors your agent-shell conversations to a remote
;; messaging transport, letting you interact with your AI agents from
;; your phone or any device.
;;
;; Features:
;; - Each agent-shell session gets its own remote thread
;; - Messages you send from Emacs appear remotely
;; - Messages from the remote transport get injected back into agent-shell
;; - Transport-agnostic core with pluggable backends (Slack, Discord)
;; - Works with any agent-shell agent (Claude, Gemini, etc.)
;;
;; Architecture:
;; - agent-shell-to-go-core.el          shared protocol, defcustoms, utilities
;; - agent-shell-to-go-slack.el         Slack transport implementation
;; - agent-shell-to-go-discord.el       Discord transport implementation
;; - agent-shell-to-go-bridge.el        agent-shell integration
;; - agent-shell-to-go.el               entry point: minor mode + public API
;;
